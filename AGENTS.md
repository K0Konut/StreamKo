# AGENTS.md — Streamy

**Purpose**  
This repo currently contains the PRD for the Streamy MVP (private streaming platform). Use the README as the source of truth for product scope and requirements.

**Repo Status (Feb 21, 2026)**  
- Monorepo scaffold created: `web/` (Vite + Vue) and `api/` (Strapi).
- Root contains `README.md` (PRD) and `AGENTS.md`.

**Working Agreements**
- Align all work to the MVP scope in `README.md`.
- Before major structural changes, confirm with the user.
- Keep changes minimal and explain new dependencies or structural decisions.
- Prefer clear, concise documentation updates over speculative implementation.
- Do not remove or rewrite the PRD unless explicitly asked.
- Branching: `main` is for releases; push feature work to `dev` unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.

**If You Need to Start Implementation**
- Ask for any missing choices (package manager, tooling) before adding new layers.

**Files**
- PRD: `README.md`
